USE CASES
- simple queue management
    * mobile application requests 
        → requires general timings/permanence analysis and/or explicit time slot assignment
        → ensures customers entrance/exit monitoring & certification
    * offline requests (kinda problematic)
        → requires current customers timings estimation 
        → requires integration with app requests
        → requires priority assignment w.r.t. app requests
        → ensures customers entrance/exit monitoring & certification with same accuracy as for app users
        → ensures service availability for offline customers

- booking
    → requires user to indicate shopping duration 
    → requires user to respect submitted duration OR → requires per customer analysis/history of shopping time
        → may require user tracing inside store (delegate time slots enforcement to humans and assume them to be honored) OR
        → may require additional consistency checks among subsequent bookings to avoid overlapping
    → requires user to indicate product categories for booked shopping session
        → in turn requires to know store physical data, products location etc.
        → may require user tracing inside store to prevent purchase of non booked product categories (and consequent overlapping)
    → ensures the max number of people allowed in the store is not exceeded

- smart booking, notifications etc.
    → requires general timings/permanence stats for both app and offline segments to provide next avail slot forecast
    → ensures no invalid slot is suggested
    → ensures suggested slot remains available for booked user and unavailable for any other.
