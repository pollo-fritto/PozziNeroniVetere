This document has been prepared to help you approaching Latex as a formatting tool for your Travlendar+ deliverables. This document suggests you a possible style and format for your deliverables and contains information about basic formatting commands in Latex. A good guide to Latex is available here \href{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf}{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf}, but you can find many other good references on the web. 

Writing in Latex means writing textual files having a \texttt{.tex} extension and exploiting the Latex markup commands for formatting purposes. Your files then need to be compiled using the Latex compiler. Similarly to programming languages, you can find many editors that help you writing and compiling your latex code. Here \href{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/}{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/} you have a short oviewview of some of them. Feel free to choose the one you like.

\subsection{Purpose}
This document has the purpose to guide the developer in the realization of the software called Clup, an application that aims to manage queues digitally.\newline
Due to the Coronavirus emergency grocery shopping needs to follow strict rules: supermarkets need to restrict access to their stores
which typically results in long lines forming outside.The goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use application that allows store
managers to regulate the influx of people and that saves people from
having to crowd outside of stores.\newline
The application releases a number that gives the position in the queue and gives information about the time when that number is called, in this way the user is able to arrive to the supermarket and enter immediately. \newline
Clup allows also the user to book a slot to enter the supermarket indicating the expected time to shop, or alternatively the application itself can infer it.\newline
Finally the application can suggest different slots to visit the store, based on the influx of people, and slots in alternative stores, based on the day/hour preferences of the user.   

\subsubsection{Goals}

\rowcolors{1}{Goldenrod}{white}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	G1 & \pbox{13cm}{Anybody is guaranteed possibility to make shopping at any supermarket in reasonable time (def. reasonable)}\\
	G2 & Users can get to know the least crowded time slots\\
	G3 & Fair users can make a reservation to enter in a supermarket\\
	G4 & Stores can easily monitor fluxes\\
	G5 & Only authorized users can access\\
	G6 & Crowds are dramatically reduced outside supermarket stores\\
    G7 & \pbox{13cm}{CLup should not decrease customer affluence beyond a reasonable level w.r.t. to normal (â†’ define reasonable)}\\
    G8 & Same shopping capabilities guaranteed to offline users\\
    G9 & \pbox{13cm}{Find the best (less crowded, soonest available) alternative among local supermarket stores (of same franchise only?)}\\
    G10 & Supermarkets do not overcrowd
\end{tabular}

COPY PASTED FROM RASD TO ANALYSE
\begin{itemize}

\item
Chapter 1 gives an introduction about the purpose of the document and the development of the
application, with its corresponding specifications such as the definitions, acronyms, abbreviation,
revision history of the document and the references.
Besides, are specified the main goals, world and shared phenomena of the software.

\item
Chapter 2 contains the overall description of the project. In the product perspective are included
the statecharts of the major function of the application and the model description through a Class
diagram. In user characteristic are explained the types of actors that can use the application.
Moreover, the product function clarified the functionalities of the application. Finally, are included
the domain assumption that can be deducted from the assignment.
