\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
Here will go wireframes
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Both users and store managers can use the application through a mobile phone or a personal computer. Users unable to do so will use totems provided by stores.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
map API\\
send ticket/booking requests to CLup\\
send turnstile entrances/exits to CLup\\
query automatically generated reports and obtain their statistics\\
\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The only type of communication required by CLup is a stable internet connection.
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
